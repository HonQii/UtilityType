## UtilityType
UtilityType is an innovative library designed to realize TypeScript's UtilityTypes in Swift. This groundbreaking library allows Swift developers to incorporate the simplicity and power of TypeScript's UtilityTypes directly into their codebase.
See more details: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html

The UtilityTypes supported are as follows:

- Partial
- Required
- Pick
- Omit
- Exclude
- Extract
- Parameters
- ReturnType

UtilityType offers an extensive set of tools to enhance your flexibility and productivity when coding in Swift, by capitalizing on its robust type system. By exploiting the capabilities of Swift's Macro feature, we've succeeded in reproducing TypeScript's UtilityTypes, offering a more refined and sophisticated Swift programming experience. Experience the difference with UtilityType!

## Partial
Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.

### Example

```swift
